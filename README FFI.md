To use C librairies, for example here with the ncurses library, compile with 'sailor examples/imperative/simple/helloworld.sl libr--ncurses'.
Thus, clang will compile with the -lncurses option.

Sail methods that use functions from the ncurses librairy are defined in the following files : print_utils.sl and print_utils_2.sl
